In the exec terminal session:

Login into your oracle database

`sqlplus / as sysdba`

Run this command to check of Oracle Dtaa Vault is added:

`
SELECT * FROM V$OPTION WHERE PARAMETER = 'Oracle Database Vault';
`
true means Oracle Data Vault is installed.

SQL> `
SELECT * FROM V$OPTION WHERE PARAMETER = 'Oracle Database Vault';
`

Oracle Database Vault
FALSE      

ALTER the SYSTEM with dv doesnt work, this command does:

`
@?/rdbms/admin/catmac.sql USERS TEMP
`



Tried add this to the dbca.bat file, located in <Oracle>/bin folder:

`dbca -J-Doracle.assistants.dbca.validate.ConfigurationParams=false`

But it didnt work.  Throws errors currently in DOS that the switch constrution of dbca -J-D is jacked up.  morfe work needed here.

To trun on log files

SELECT name, value 
FROM v$diag_info 
WHERE name = 'Attention Log';


`
ALTER SESSION SET CONTAINER = CDB$ROOT;
ALTER SYSTEM SET enable_DV = TRUE SCOPE=SPFILE;
SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE;
STARTUP;
`
